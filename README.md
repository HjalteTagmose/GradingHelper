# GradingHelper 

I worked as a TA and often had to test a lot of similar hand-ins, so I made this code to help with grading.

### Use
To use it, simply paste all the files in the directory, where your hand-ins are located, then open the 'init.bat'.
Note, this is specifically made for Java! Also obviously the code has to be edited to work with the exact assignment you're grading, so some editing is required.

### What does it do
1. It will search all folders and unzip all zip files.
2. It will search all folders and find where the actual code is located and:
    - Remove junk files (.class, .ctxt, .bluej)
    - Paste testing files (based on assignment type)

Once test files are pasted you can look through the code and open the .bat to quickly test everything!
